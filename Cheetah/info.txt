   with the same architecture/platform as the executable program.
2. You can also type "go run cheetah" for direct execution by Go.
3. Alternatively, you can type "go install" to install it on the $GOPATH\bin.

does NOT depend on Go. Although you can build your own, this is still included in the release 
for convenience.
