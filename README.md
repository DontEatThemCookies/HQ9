# David Costell's HQ9+

## Announcement: PythonHQ9+ v2 releases with Phoenix Engine v1.2!

This repository contains my HQ9+ implementations. They are licensed under the MIT License.

HQ9+ is a joke esoteric programming language with only four instructions. They are:
```
H - Print "Hello, World!"

Q - Quine (interpretation varies between implementations)

9 - Prints the canonical lyrics to the 99 Bottles of Beer song.

+ - Increments an inaccessible accumulator by one.
```
Development work is focused on PythonHQ9+ and Cheetah. PyHQ9+ is a Python3 implementation, while Cheetah is written in Go.

Original HQ9+ concept credited to Cliff L. Biffle, 2001.
