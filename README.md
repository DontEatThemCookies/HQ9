# David Costell's HQ9+
This repository contains my HQ9+ implementations. They are licensed under the MIT License.

Development work is focused on PythonHQ9+, an implementation in Python.

NOTE: The compiler is still in its beta stages and functionality is **incomplete!**

The original HQ9+ concept is credited to Cliff L. Biffle, 2001.
