# David Costell's HQ9+

## Announcement: Development on Phoenix Engine REMAINS ACTIVE, however a new HQ9+ implementation written in Go is also being worked on! Stay tuned!

This repository contains my HQ9+ implementations. They are licensed under the MIT License.

HQ9+ is a joke esoteric programming language with only four instructions. They are:
```
H - Print "Hello, World!"

Q - Multiply "Q" by the number of times it appears in the input and prints it out (e.g. "QQ" prints out "QQQQ"

9 - Prints the canonical lyrics to the 99 Bottles of Beer song.

+ - Increments an inaccessible accumulator by one.
```
Development work is focused on PythonHQ9+, an implementation in Python.

Original HQ9+ concept credited to Cliff L. Biffle, 2001.
